# ASTABLE-555-TIMER---AUTODESK-EAGLE
To create a IC 555 timer using Autodesk eagle
***
step 1: In Autodesk Eagle, create a new project under the project sector. Name the file as Astable 555 timer. Now under Astable 555 timer create a Schematic file.
***
step 2: allocate nessasary grid lines value in the grid section such that the editor page comes with the sutable grid lines
***
step 3: using add components tool take the respective parts and place it in the schematic with refernce to the circuit diagram. Refer the data sheet to allocate the values to the components.
***
step 4: now connect the components in the schematic using net tool. 
***
step 5: by using value tool assign the values of resistors, capacitors.
***
step 6: now create a board, such that the diamentions of the board must be 60*50 mm.
***
step 7: move the components into the board and route the components using Air Routeing tool.
***
step 8: select polygon tool and extend its streach to the entire board. Name it as Ground. Now by appling Ratsnest tool the polygon (ground) gets activated.
***
step 9: to give the name to board use Name tool. Enter the appropriate name and place it on the board with the Name Layer activated.
***
step 10: Drill four holes in each corner. By accessing Manufacturing tool we will get to know about the completed pcb board
